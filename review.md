Major – src/components/providers/session-provider.tsx (line 78): Setting refetchInterval={5 * 60} turns on periodic /api/auth/session polling every 5 minutes for every tab. NextAuth’s default is no polling; with the SSR session already injected this extra timer can increase overall session traffic and counter the “reduce duplicate calls” goal. Consider leaving it at 0 (default) and relying on manual triggers if/when needed.
Minor – src/components/providers/session-provider.tsx (line 55): The Zustand sync writes fabricated session metadata (expires_at always “now + 7 days”, tokens hard-coded strings) rather than using session.expires or real token data. If any consumer uses the auth store to gate access or call APIs, they’ll see misleading expiry/token values. Either map the real session.expires/JWT data or keep the store null/NextAuth-shaped to avoid divergence.
Open Questions

Do we have any consumers of useAuthStore that depend on access/refresh tokens or expiry? If so, we likely need to align the store shape to NextAuth rather than mock values.
Was the added polling measured to reduce calls in practice? If not, should we revert to the default (no polling) and only disable refetchOnWindowFocus?
